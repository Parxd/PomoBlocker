# **PomoBlocker**

## Project Description
PomoBlocker is a Python GUI application built with Tkinter & [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). This application essentially combines the [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) productivity technique with a website blocker. The website blocker works by adding inputted websites to the Windows hosts file.

### Features
Users can...
- set custom Pomodoro times for the three cycles (work period, short break period, long break period)
- block websites during any of these three cycles
- set preferred notification settings

### Features to implement in the future...
- Ability for users to login to save their custom settings using SQLite
- Linux/Mac compatability
- Block applications by editing the Windows registry
